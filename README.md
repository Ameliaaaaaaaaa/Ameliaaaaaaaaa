- Hi, I’m @Ameliaaaaaaaaa!
- I’m interested in existing in my true form, as well as math and the sciences, especially biology and chemistry. I also do a bit of "coding" (usually working on little games with my friends in renpy, a very simple and high-level language).
- I’m currently learning a lot about humans and how they work!
- I chose the benzene ring for my profile picture because it is a very common functional group with interesting properties and because its skeletal formula is simple and looks cool in my opinion.
- How to reach me: email or discord. If you know who I am you should already have these; otherwise, you can have my burner email 539hexisawes0me at gmail dot com, though since it is an alternate I do not check it often and so you may not get a timely response.
