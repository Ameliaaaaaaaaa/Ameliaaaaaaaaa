- Hi, I’m @Ameliaaaaaaaaa!
- I’m interested in existing in my true form, as well as math and the sciences. I also do a bit of coding (usually working on little renpy games with my friends or trying and failing to do Minecraft-mod-related stuff)
- I’m currently learning a lot about humans and how they work!
- How to reach me: email or discord. If you know who I am you should already have these; otherwise, you can have my burner email 539hexisawes0me at gmail dot com, though since it is an alternate I do not check it often and so you may not get a timely response.
