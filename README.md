Hi, I’m @Ameliaaaaaaaaa!
\n I’m interested in existing in my true form, as well as math and the sciences. I also do a bit of coding (usually working on little renpy games with my friends or trying and failing to do Minecraft-mod-related stuff)
\n I’m currently learning a lot about humans and how they work!
\n How to reach me: email or discord. If you know who I am you should already have these; try the email attached to this account.
